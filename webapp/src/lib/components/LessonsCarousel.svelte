		{
			id: 1,
			title: "Planning Upfront Works Well",
			summary: "Clear structure and requirements lead to better AI agent interactions",
			insight: "The clearer your initial requirements and architecture, the more effectively AI agents can contribute to implementation.",
			content: "The most successful AI agent interactions started with clear structure and requirements. I began the ccbilling project with a comprehensive requirements document that outlined the data model, user flows, and technical constraints."
		},
		{
			id: 2,
			title: "Automated Checks Are More Valuable",
			summary: "Quality automation becomes essential with AI-generated code",
			insight: "Automation isn't just about speed - it's about providing AI agents with structured, actionable feedback they can act upon.",
			content: "With AI agents generating significant portions of code, automated quality checks become essential rather than optional. I leveraged SonarCloud for comprehensive code quality analysis."
		},
		{
			id: 3,
			title: "Coding on Just a Phone Is Doable",
			summary: "Cursor's agent mode enables mobile development workflows",
			insight: "The future of development isn't tied to a specific device or location - AI agents enable truly mobile development workflows.",
			content: "One of the most surprising discoveries was Cursor's agent mode webapp, which allows you to operate the AI agent outside of the IDE through a web interface."
		},
		{
			id: 4,
			title: "Environment Iteration Becomes Critical",
			summary: "Safe experimentation requires preview deployments",
			insight: "When AI agents can work autonomously, you need systems that let you observe and iterate on their work safely.",
			content: "Given the ability to code from anywhere, having an environment that supports rapid iteration becomes even more important."
		},
		{
			id: 5,
			title: "UI Changes Remained Difficult",
			summary: "Visual design requires clear component systems",
			insight: "AI agents excel at logic and structure but struggle with subjective visual decisions. Clear design systems and component libraries are essential.",
			content: "Despite AI agents' capabilities, UI changes proved challenging. Describing placement and styling in natural language is inherently imprecise."
		},
		{
			id: 6,
			title: "There Were Bugs to Work Around",
			summary: "AI agents introduce new failure modes requiring workarounds",
			insight: "AI agents introduce new failure modes that require creative workarounds and clear documentation.",
			content: "AI agents aren't perfect, and I encountered several technical issues that required workarounds. For example, my use of zsh with powerlevel10k caused Cursor to hang."
		},
		{
			id: 7,
			title: "Newer Frameworks Are Challenging",
			summary: "Cutting-edge technologies need reference implementations",
			insight: "AI agents work best with established patterns and examples. For cutting-edge technologies, you need to create your own reference implementations.",
			content: "The agent struggled significantly with Svelte 5's runes mode and its approach to UI reactivity. The newer the framework or feature, the less training data the agent has access to."
		},
		{
			id: 8,
			title: "More Software Will Be Written",
			summary: "AI agents lower barriers to software creation",
			insight: "AI agents don't replace programmers - they enable more people to create more software to solve more problems.",
			content: "There's an ongoing debate about what AI agents mean for the programming profession. I'm relatively optimistic: I believe this will make it much easier to create new software."
		},
		{
			id: 9,
			title: "Quality Can Actually Improve",
			summary: "AI agents can raise software quality through best practices",
			insight: "AI agents can raise software quality by implementing best practices and enabling architectural experimentation that would be too time-consuming otherwise.",
			content: "A common concern is that AI-generated code will lower software quality. In my experience, when used well, the opposite can be true."
		},
		{
			id: 10,
			title: "Surprisingly Fun",
			summary: "Working with AI agents can be genuinely enjoyable",
			insight: "AI agents can make development more collaborative and engaging, not less human.",
			content: "Perhaps most unexpectedly, working with AI agents was genuinely enjoyable. The back-and-forth on approaches mimicked the collaborative feeling of working with other developers."
