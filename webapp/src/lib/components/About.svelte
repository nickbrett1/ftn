		Then let me introduce myself. My name is <span class="text-green-400 font-bold">Nick Brett</span

		the data that drives markets.

			Over nearly 20 years, I've <a
				class="link-yellow underline underline-offset-2"
				href="#experience">worked in most of the key functions for fintech data</a
			>, from managing global data partner relationships at Bloomberg LP, to building the data
			systems that power the investment of over $60B AUM at Two Sigma. I've managed worldwide
			organizations, with teams from Tokyo to New York, Dubai to Sydney; and taken high impact
			individual contributor roles to be a hands-on leader for new initiatives. For most of my
			career I've worked as an Engineer, but for several years I ran a Product Management team, and
			today I look to marry all the skills needed to

		<p class="mt-8 text-sm leading-normal text-white sm:text-base">
			I've learned a lot over that time about the systems, products, processes and people necessary
			to build a data factory that can power buy-side and sell-side businesses. From capturing
			metadata to prevent look-ahead-bias for alpha modeling, to tracing data lineage across
			heterogenous systems for data governance, while operating a scaled global data onboarding
			operation. I believe many data problems sit at the intersection of technology, product and
			people, and benefit from the multi-disciplinary approach that I bring.

			Software Engineers that partner with multiple Two Sigma quant teams to produce short-horizon forecasts
