		Then let me introduce myself. My name is <span class="text-green-400 font-bold">Nick Brett</span

		drives markets.

			Over nearly 20 years, I've worked in most of the key functions for fintech data, from managing
			global data partner relationships at Bloomberg LP, to building the data systems to deliver
			massive scale analytics at Meta. I've managed worldwide organizations, with teams from Tokyo
			to New York, Dubai to Sydney. And taken high impact individual contributor roles to be the
			hands-on leader for new initiatives. For most of my career I've worked as an Engineer, but for
			3-years I ran a Product Management team, and have a passion for marrying the skills to <strong

			I've learned a lot over that time about the systems and products, processes and people
			necessary to build a data factory that can power buy-side and sell-side businesses. From
			capturing metadata to prevent look-ahead-bias for alpha modeling, to tracing data lineage
			across heterogenous sytems for data governance and operating a scaled global data onboarding
			operation. I believe many data problems sit at the intersection of technology, product and
			people, and benefit from the multi-disciplinary approach that I bring.
