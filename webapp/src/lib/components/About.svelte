			I've learned a lot over that time about the systems, products, processes and people necessary
			to build a data factory that can power buy-side and sell-side businesses. From capturing
			metadata to prevent look-ahead-bias for alpha modeling, to tracing data lineage across
			heterogenous systems for data governance, while operating a scaled global data onboarding
			operation. I believe many data problems sit at the intersection of technology, product and
			people, and benefit from the multi-disciplinary approach that I bring.
