# Admin Migration: Script to UI

## Overview
Successfully migrated the `normalize-production.js` script functionality to a web-based admin interface accessible through the ccbilling application.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Removed the Script
- Deleted `webapp/scripts/normalize-production.js`
- The script was using direct database commands via `wrangler d1 execute` which required CLI access

### 2. Created Admin UI
- New admin page at `/projects/ccbilling/admin`
- Accessible via "Admin" button on the main ccbilling page
- Provides the same functionality as the script but through a web interface

### 3. Leveraged Existing API
- The admin page uses the existing `/api/admin/normalize-merchants` endpoint
- This endpoint already had all the necessary logic for:
  - Getting normalization statistics
  - Running batch normalization processes
  - Handling both payment and budget_merchant tables
  - Error handling and progress tracking

## Features of the New Admin Interface

### Statistics Dashboard
- Total payments count
- Normalized payments count
- Pending normalization count
- Unique normalized merchants count
- Budget merchant mapping statistics

### Normalization Process
- One-click normalization execution
- Real-time progress tracking
- Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- Automatic completion detection
- Error reporting and display

### Sample Data
- Shows examples of successful normalizations
- Displays original vs. normalized merchant names
- Includes merchant details and frequency counts

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Categorized by payment vs. budget merchant
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Accessibility**: Can now run normalization from anywhere via web browser
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: See progress and results immediately
3. **Better Error Handling**: Visual display of any issues encountered
4. **No CLI Required**: Eliminates need for terminal access
5. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged through the web interface
6. **Consistent UI**: Follows the same design patterns as the rest of the application

## Usage

1. Navigate to the main ccbilling page
2. Click the "Admin" button
3. Review current normalization statistics
4. Click "Start Normalization" to begin the process
5. Monitor progress in real-time
6. Review results and any errors

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Svelte component with reactive state management
- **Backend**: Existing API endpoint with batch processing
- **Authentication**: Uses existing user authentication system
- **Database**: Direct D1 database access through Cloudflare Workers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and display
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates during long-running operations

## Security

- Admin functionality is protected by the existing authentication system
- Only authenticated users can access the normalization features
- Database operations are performed through secure API endpoints
- No direct database access from the frontend

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Scheduled normalization jobs
- More detailed progress bars
- Export functionality for normalization reports
- Custom normalization rules configuration
- Rollback capabilities for failed normalizations
