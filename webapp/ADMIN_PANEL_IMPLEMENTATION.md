# CCBilling Admin Panel Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully refactored the `normalize-production.js` script into a web-based admin panel that can be accessed from your production CCBilling application. This allows you to run merchant normalization directly from the web interface without needing access to your local development machine.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Admin Button on Main CCBilling Page
- Added an "Admin Panel" button to the main CCBilling page (`/projects/ccbilling`)
- The button is positioned alongside other management buttons (Create New Billing Cycle, Manage Credit Cards, Manage Budgets)

### 2. Admin Panel Page (`/projects/ccbilling/admin`)
- **Location**: `webapp/src/routes/projects/ccbilling/admin/+page.svelte`
- **Server Handler**: `webapp/src/routes/projects/ccbilling/admin/+page.server.js`
- **Authentication**: Protected by your existing authentication system

### 3. Features
- **Real-time Statistics**: Shows current normalization status
  - Total payments
  - Already normalized payments
  - Pending normalizations
  - Unique merchants count
- **Sample Normalizations**: Displays examples of how merchants are being normalized
- **Action Buttons**:
  - **Run Single Batch**: Processes one batch of merchants (50 by default)
  - **Run Full Normalization**: Processes all remaining merchants automatically
  - **Refresh Stats**: Updates the statistics display
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress during normalization
- **Error Handling**: Displays any errors that occur during processing

### 4. Security
- The admin panel is protected by your existing authentication system
- Only authenticated users can access the panel
- The underlying API endpoints are also protected

## How It Works

### Frontend (Admin Panel)
1. **Statistics Display**: Shows current normalization status using the existing `/api/admin/normalize-merchants` GET endpoint
2. **Batch Processing**: Uses the POST endpoint to process merchants in batches
3. **Full Normalization**: Automatically processes all remaining merchants by calling the API repeatedly until complete

### Backend (Existing API)
- The admin panel uses your existing `/api/admin/normalize-merchants` API endpoint
- This endpoint already implements the merchant normalization logic
- It processes payments in batches to avoid timeouts
- It also handles budget_merchant table updates

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Access the Admin Panel
1. Navigate to your CCBilling application
2. Click the "Admin Panel" button on the main page
3. You'll be redirected to `/projects/ccbilling/admin`

### 2. View Current Status
- The panel automatically loads and displays current normalization statistics
- You can see how many payments need normalization
- View sample normalizations to understand the process

### 3. Run Normalization
- **Single Batch**: Click "Run Single Batch" to process one batch of merchants
- **Full Normalization**: Click "Run Full Normalization" to process all remaining merchants
- Monitor progress in real-time
- View results and any errors that occur

### 4. Monitor Progress
- The interface shows real-time progress during normalization
- Statistics are automatically updated after each operation
- Any errors are clearly displayed

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified
1. **`webapp/src/routes/projects/ccbilling/+page.svelte`**
   - Added Admin Panel button
2. **`webapp/src/routes/projects/ccbilling/admin/+page.svelte`**
   - New admin panel component
3. **`webapp/src/routes/projects/ccbilling/admin/+page.server.js`**
   - Server-side authentication handler
4. **`webapp/src/routes/projects/ccbilling/admin/page.test.js`**
   - Test file for the admin panel

### Dependencies
- Uses existing components: Header, Footer, Button
- Integrates with existing authentication system
- Uses existing API endpoints

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Local Access Required**: You can run normalization from anywhere with web access
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: See progress and results immediately
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based interface instead of command-line script
4. **Secure**: Protected by your existing authentication
5. **Integrated**: Part of your main application, not a separate tool
6. **Maintainable**: Uses existing code structure and patterns

## Testing the Implementation

To test that everything works:

1. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd webapp
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run Tests** (if vitest is available):
   ```bash
   npm run test:once -- src/routes/projects/ccbilling/admin/page.test.js
   ```

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to `/projects/ccbilling`
   - Click "Admin Panel"
   - Verify the interface loads correctly
   - Test the normalization functions

## Deployment

The admin panel will be automatically deployed when you deploy your main application since it's part of the same codebase. No additional deployment steps are required.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements you could consider:

1. **Scheduled Normalization**: Add ability to schedule automatic normalization
2. **Custom Rules**: Allow admins to add custom normalization rules
3. **Audit Log**: Track who ran normalization and when
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add other admin functions like bulk data cleanup
5. **Performance Metrics**: Show normalization performance over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure you're logged in to access the admin panel
2. **API Errors**: Check browser console for any API call failures
3. **Build Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the API endpoints are accessible
3. Ensure your authentication system is working correctly

## Conclusion

The admin panel provides a secure, user-friendly way to run merchant normalization directly from your production application. It eliminates the need for local development machine access while providing better visibility into the normalization process.

The implementation follows your existing code patterns and integrates seamlessly with your current authentication and API infrastructure.
