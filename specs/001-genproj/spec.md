# Feature Specification: Project Generation Tool (genproj)

**Feature Branch**: `001-genproj`  
**Created**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Here's my problem. I've put a lot of effort into this ftn project, adding numerous tools to ensure I have an efficient development environment that produces high quality results. However if I want to create a new project, I have to setup all those tools from scratch. Some of that is relatively straightforward, such as copying over say the Dockerfile and making edits for my new project. Or creating the project on GitHub. But other things are more tricky, such as setting up a new CircleCI project for CI/CD. And of course for a new project, there are some capabilities that I generally will always want, such as a CircleCI deployment pipeline, but others will be optional. I won't for example need a Lighthouse test if I have no front-end. To make it easy for me to create new projects, I'd like to create a tool within ftn that has a UI interface that will allow me to create a new project with the set of capabilities I want and for the tool to go ahead and generate all the required code and as much as possible configurations in external services so I can accelerate my development. Obviously this tool should sit behind my authentication before it creates artifacts for my service, but without logging in, the UI should still show the available capabilities to pick from, even if it can't be run. That makes for a nice demo. A login button should be present to allow me to login via my normal google authentication workflow."

**Constitution Compliance**: This specification must align with principles in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, particularly:

- **Principle II**: Testing Standards (TDD with acceptance scenarios)
- **Principle III**: UX Consistency (user-centered design, accessibility)
- **Principle IV**: Performance Requirements (measurable success criteria)
- **Principle V**: Security & Compliance (data protection, audit requirements)
