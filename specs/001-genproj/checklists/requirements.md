# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Generation Tool (genproj)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](/workspaces/ftn/specs/001-here-s-my/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and testable
- User stories are independently testable and deliver value
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Authentication flow optimized: Preview without auth → Generate with conditional auth
- Bidirectional navigation between configuration and preview modes specified
- GitHub authentication requirement properly integrated into user flow
- CircleCI authentication requirement properly integrated for CI/CD operations
- Doppler authentication requirement properly integrated for secrets management operations
- SonarCloud authentication requirement properly integrated for code quality operations
- README.md documentation requirements clearly specified with comprehensive content structure
- Celebration animation requirements specified for enhanced user experience
- Authentication flow clearly defined: Preview (no auth) → Generate (Google required) → GitHub (required for repository operations) → CircleCI/Doppler/SonarCloud (required for respective operations)
