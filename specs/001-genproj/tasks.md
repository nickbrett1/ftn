# Tasks: Project Generation Tool (genproj)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-genproj/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks must adhere to principles in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- **Principle I**: Code Quality Standards (linting, type safety, code review)
- **Principle II**: Testing Standards (TDD mandatory - tests before implementation)
- **Principle III**: UX Consistency (accessibility, responsive design, design system)
- **Principle IV**: Performance Requirements (bundle size, response times, monitoring)
- **Principle V**: Security & Compliance (encryption, audit logging, security scanning)
- **Principle VI**: Site Consistency & Component Standards (header/footer, component reuse)
- **Principle VII**: Database Schema Management Standards (schema creation patterns)
- **Principle VIII**: Cloudflare Services Integration Standards (direct D1/R2 usage)
- **Principle IX**: Code Organization Standards (lib/ folder structure)
- **Principle X**: Simple Logging Standards (console.\* with emoji prefixes)
- **Principle XI**: Error Handling Standards (RouteUtils.handleError, user-friendly messages)

**Tests**: Following Principle II (Testing Standards), TDD is MANDATORY. Tests must be written FIRST, approved by user, and FAIL before implementation begins. Test coverage must meet 85% minimum threshold.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `webapp/src/`, `webapp/tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the SvelteKit structure from plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for capability display
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 for preview functionality
- **User Stories 5-9 (P2)**: Can start after US4 completion - Each is independently testable
- **User Story 10 (P3)**: Can start after US4 completion - Depends on successful generation

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1, 3 can start in parallel
- User Stories 2, 4 can start after US1 completion
- User Stories 5-9 can run in parallel after US4 completion
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for capabilities endpoint in webapp/tests/contract/test_capabilities_api.js"
Task: "Integration test for capability browsing in webapp/tests/integration/test_capability_browsing.js"
Task: "E2E test for unauthenticated capability viewing in webapp/tests/e2e/genproj_capabilities.spec.js"

# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create capabilities API endpoint in webapp/src/routes/projects/genproj/api/capabilities/+server.js"
Task: "Create main genproj page component in webapp/src/routes/projects/genproj/+page.svelte"
Task: "Create CapabilitySelector component in webapp/src/lib/components/genproj/CapabilitySelector.svelte"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Browse Capabilities)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Two-Tab Interface)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Authentication)
6. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (Project Generation)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all MVP stories independently
8. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic capability browsing)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Two-tab interface)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Authentication)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full MVP!)
6. Add User Stories 5-9 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (External services)
7. Add User Story 10 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Celebration)
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Capabilities)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Authentication)
3. Once US1 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Two-Tab Interface)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Project Generation)
4. Once US4 is done:
   - Developer A: User Stories 5-6 (CircleCI, Documentation)
   - Developer B: User Stories 7-8 (Doppler, SonarCloud)
   - Developer C: User Stories 9-10 (External Services, Celebration)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Follow SvelteKit conventions for file structure
- Use existing Google authentication system
- Implement two-tab interface as specified in updated spec
- All external service integrations should be optional and gracefully degrade
- Celebration animation should be accessible and performant
