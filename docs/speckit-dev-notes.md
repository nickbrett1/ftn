I'd like to create an article with a similar style (both the style of writing and the layout, fonts, styling, etc..) to that in webapp/src/routes/dbt-duckdb/dbt-duckdb.svx as well as webapp/src/routes/building-with-ai/building-with-ai.svx that will discuss what I've learned using Spec Kit (https://github.com/github/spec-kit). As before I'd like to use a nice meme to hook people with an image, like I used in the previously two articles.

I want you to create a first draft of this article under webapp/src/projects/speckit-dev/speckit-dev.svx

Here's the structure that I propose we follow along with notes for each section to use:

Stuff:
* Ran out of money for cursor
* Google Code Assist no good
* Big changes no good
