I'd like to create an article with a similar style (both the style of writing and the layout, fonts, styling, etc..) to that in webapp/src/routes/dbt-duckdb/dbt-duckdb.svx as well as webapp/src/routes/building-with-ai/building-with-ai.svx that will discuss what I've learned using Spec Kit (https://github.com/github/spec-kit). As before I'd like to use a nice meme to hook people with an image, like I used in the previously two articles.

I want you to create a first draft of this article under webapp/src/projects/speckit-dev/speckit-dev.svx

Here's the structure that I propose we follow along with notes for each section to use:

Stuff:
* Explain project, why it seemed like a good match
* Ran out of money for cursor
* Google Code Assist no good - not enough context, but ok for file level changes
* Big changes no good - thing runs too far off in the wrong direction
* Hard to iterate on specs
* Need to think about scope of change
* Tried antigravity - ran out of credits very quickly
* Tried Gemini - no strict limits, benfit
* Jules better than Cursor equivalent, didnt get stuck. but uses lots of memory and can lack feedback, eg slow. But cool bew features, eg suggestions
* MCP helped eg with sonarqube and svelte5
* Next - local LLM? Want to try a hardware project.
