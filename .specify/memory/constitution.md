# FTN Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards

**Code quality is non-negotiable and must be measurable.**

All code contributions MUST:

- Maintain consistent style enforced by automated linting (ESLint, Prettier)
- Follow language-specific best practices (TypeScript strict mode, SvelteKit conventions)
- Include type safety where applicable (no `any` types without explicit justification)
- Be self-documenting with clear naming conventions; comments explain _why_, not _what_
- Pass automated code quality gates (SonarCloud Quality Gate must pass)
- Address all critical and high-severity linter warnings before merge
- Achieve minimum technical debt rating of 'A' in SonarCloud

**Rationale**: Financial applications require predictable, maintainable code. Automated quality gates ensure consistent standards without blocking velocity. Technical debt must be tracked and managed proactively.

### II. Testing Standards

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory for all feature work.**

Testing requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:

- **Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced**: Write failing tests → User approval → Implement → Refactor
- **Minimum coverage**: 85% unit and integration test coverage required for all new code
- **Test types required**:
  - Unit tests: All business logic, utilities, and pure functions
  - Integration tests: API endpoints, database interactions, external service integrations
  - Contract tests: API contracts between frontend/backend, external dependencies
- **Test quality standards**:
  - Tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests allowed in main branch)
  - Tests must be independent (no test execution order dependencies)
  - Tests must be fast (<5 seconds per unit test suite, <30 seconds per integration suite)
- **Security testing**: All authentication/authorization flows, data validation, input sanitization
- **Performance testing**: Critical paths measured for regression (Lighthouse CI >95 score)

**Rationale**: Fintech applications demand reliability. TDD ensures features are designed for testability and validates requirements before implementation. Coverage thresholds prevent regression and build confidence for continuous deployment.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**User experience must be consistent, accessible, and delightful across all touchpoints.**

UX requirements are MANDATORY:

- **Accessibility first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required for all interactive elements
  - Semantic HTML enforced
  - ARIA attributes required where HTML semantics insufficient
  - Keyboard navigation fully supported
  - Screen reader testing performed for critical flows
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach, tested on 320px–2560px viewports
- **Performance budgets**:
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP): <1.5s
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1
  - Time to Interactive (TTI): <3.5s
- **Design system**: All UI components must use the established TailwindCSS design tokens
  - Colors, spacing, typography from design system only
  - Component library (Storybook) documents all reusable components
  - No inline styles or magic numbers
- **User feedback**: All state changes provide clear feedback (loading states, success/error messages)
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages that guide resolution without exposing technical details

**Rationale**: Financial tools handle sensitive data and critical operations. Users must trust the interface through consistent, accessible, and performant experiences. Design systems ensure quality at scale.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**Performance is a feature and must be continuously monitored and optimized.**

Performance standards MUST be met:

- **Frontend performance**:
  - Lighthouse Performance score ≥95 (CI enforced)
  - Bundle size budget: <200KB initial JS, <500KB total for critical paths
  - Code splitting enforced for routes and heavy components
  - Images optimized (WebP/AVIF with fallbacks, responsive srcsets)
  - Fonts subset and preloaded
- **Backend performance**:
  - API response time p95 <200ms for reads, <500ms for writes
  - Database queries optimized (EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN reviewed for N+1, missing indexes)
  - Caching strategy implemented (Cloudflare edge caching, in-memory caching where appropriate)
- **Infrastructure performance**:
  - Global CDN distribution (Cloudflare Workers edge network)
  - Cold start time <50ms for serverless functions
  - Database connection pooling and optimization
- **Monitoring**:
  - Real User Monitoring (RUM) tracks actual user performance
  - Synthetic monitoring validates critical paths every 5 minutes
  - Performance regression alerts before deployment
  - Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD pipeline

**Rationale**: Users expect instant feedback, especially in financial applications where delays erode trust. Performance directly impacts conversion, engagement, and user satisfaction. Continuous monitoring prevents regression.

### V. Security & Compliance

**Security and data protection are fundamental requirements for all fintech operations.**

Security requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE:

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Secure session management with encrypted cookies
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) supported for sensitive operations
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at API and UI levels
  - Password requirements enforced (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements)
- **Data Protection**:
  - Encryption at rest (D1 database, R2 storage)
  - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3 minimum)
  - Sensitive data never logged or exposed in error messages
  - PII handling follows GDPR compliance guidelines
- **Security Scanning**:
  - GitGuardian secret scanning prevents credential leaks
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (Snyk/npm audit) with zero critical vulnerabilities allowed
  - Static application security testing (SAST) in CI pipeline
  - Security headers enforced (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Audit & Compliance**:
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all data access and mutations
  - Immutable audit trail for financial transactions
  - Data retention policies enforced
  - Regular security reviews and penetration testing
- **Incident Response**:
  - Security incident response plan documented
  - Breach notification procedures defined
  - Rollback procedures tested and documented

**Rationale**: Financial applications are high-value targets for attackers. Proactive security measures, continuous scanning, and compliance adherence protect users and the business. Security must be built in, not bolted on.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Requirements

All code changes MUST:

- Pass automated CI/CD pipeline (tests, linting, security scanning, performance checks)
- Receive approval from at least one team member
- Include tests demonstrating changed functionality
- Update relevant documentation (inline comments, README, specs)
- Address all reviewer feedback or document reasons for deferral

**Blocking conditions** (no merge until resolved):

- Test coverage drops below 85%
- SonarCloud Quality Gate fails
- Critical or high security vulnerabilities detected

### Branching & Deployment Strategy

- **Preview deployments**: Automatic preview URLs for all feature branches
- **Zero-downtime deployments**: Rolling deployments with health checks
- **Rollback capability**: Previous version deployable within 2 minutes
- **Deployment frequency**: Continuous deployment to production after PR merge (if all gates pass)

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Implementation Gates

Before starting feature implementation, validate:

1. **Specification complete**: User stories with acceptance criteria defined
2. **Tests planned**: Test scenarios identified and agreed upon
3. **Performance budget**: Performance targets defined for new features
4. **Security review**: Security implications assessed and mitigations planned
5. **Accessibility review**: A11y requirements identified

### Pre-Merge Gates

Before merging to main, validate:

1. **All tests passing**: Unit, integration, contract tests green
2. **Coverage maintained**: ≥85% coverage maintained or improved
3. **Code quality gates**: SonarCloud Quality Gate passed
4. **Performance validated**: Lighthouse CI ≥95, no performance regression
5. **Security validated**: No critical/high vulnerabilities, secrets scanning passed
6. **Accessibility validated**: No WCAG violations introduced
7. **Documentation updated**: README, inline docs, specs updated as needed

### Post-Deployment Gates

After deploying to production, validate:

1. **Health checks passing**: Application responsive and functional
2. **Error rates normal**: No spike in error rates or logs
3. **Performance within SLA**: RUM metrics within acceptable ranges
4. **Monitoring active**: Alerts configured and functioning

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitution changes require:

1. **Proposal**: Documented rationale for change with impact analysis
2. **Discussion**: Team review and feedback period (minimum 48 hours)
3. **Approval**: Consensus from engineering leads
4. **Migration plan**: Steps to bring existing code into compliance (if applicable)
5. **Version bump**: Semantic versioning of constitution
   - **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
   - **MINOR**: New principles or materially expanded guidance
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes
6. **Documentation**: All dependent templates and guides updated
7. **Communication**: Team notified of changes and training provided if needed

### Compliance Reviews

- **Daily**: Automated CI/CD pipeline enforces code quality, testing, security, performance gates
- **Weekly**: Review failed builds and quality trends; address systemic issues
- **Monthly**: Review technical debt metrics and prioritize remediation
- **Quarterly**: Full constitution compliance audit; identify gaps and improvement opportunities
- **Annually**: Constitution effectiveness review; major updates as needed

### Exception Process

Principle violations require explicit justification:

1. **Document exception**: Why deviation necessary, what alternatives considered
2. **Time-box exception**: Temporary exceptions have expiration dates
3. **Mitigation plan**: How risks will be managed during exception period
4. **Approval required**: Engineering lead approval for any principle violation
5. **Track exceptions**: All exceptions logged and reviewed monthly

**Note**: Security and testing standards have no exceptions. These principles are absolute.

### Decision Framework

When making technical decisions, evaluate against principles in order:

1. **Security first**: Does this compromise security or data protection? If yes, reject.
2. **Testing coverage**: Can this be tested effectively? If no, redesign.
3. **Performance impact**: Does this degrade user experience? If yes, optimize or reject.
4. **Accessibility impact**: Does this harm accessibility? If yes, fix or reject.
5. **Code quality**: Does this increase maintainability burden? If yes, simplify.
6. **User value**: Does this deliver user value proportional to complexity? If no, defer.

All technical decisions must be documented in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) when they:

- Introduce new technologies or frameworks
- Establish new patterns or conventions
- Make tradeoffs between competing principles
- Impact system architecture or data models
